In this case the input and\r\nprogram itself will not have to be maintained in the future and so\r\ndon't have to be particularly beautiful or well described.\r\n\r\nMy Erlang book is an example of this. Once the book is published,\r\nmaintaining the inputs and the program that produced the book is not\r\nnecessary. The result looks nice, but the input is a mess of XML files\r\nand small test programs that will never have to be maintained.\r\n\r\nErrata for the book, and corrections necessary made in re-printings\r\nwill only involve small changes to the inputs which are easy to make,\r\neven if the inputs to the program are not well documented.\r\n\r\n# Programs that must be maintained\r\n\r\nFor program that have to be maintained the opposite to the last scenario\r\nis true. The inputs to the program and the program itself must be\r\nbeautiful and well-documented.\r\n\r\nI was talking to a computer consultant the other day who made web\r\napplications. He said that as soon as the output of the program\r\nlooked correct (ie the web site looked OK and the program appeared to\r\nwork) the customer assumed the project was over and the project\r\nmanagers moved him on to the next project.\r\n\r\nThere was no time, and no understanding for the point of view that\r\nnot only should the web site look ok, but the code that produced it\r\nshould be cleaned up and documented before the next project was\r\nstarted. And this was for projects that would have to be maintained in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n# What else makes programming difficult?\r\n\r\nThere are three other things that make programming difficult:\r\n\r\n* Fixing things that should not be broken\r\n* No time for learning things\r\n* Bad environment for programming\r\n\r\nLet's look at these things - these are all ``time thieves''\r\n\r\n# Fixing things that should not be broken\r\n\r\nOften I have to use software that I have not written and do not really\r\nunderstand in order to solve a particular problem.\r\n\r\nIn the best case, the program that I have to use has an accurate\r\ndescription of how to use it. But what often happens is that the\r\nprogram has either no description or an incorrect description.\r\n\r\nSo what do you do when the documentation says ``do XYZ and PQR will\r\nhappen'' and you do ``XYZ'' but ``PQR'' does not happen? If you are\r\nlucky the person who wrote the program is nearby so you can go and\r\nstrangle them, failing this you can either try your luck with Google,\r\nor poke around in the source code looking for the answer.\r\n\r\nUsing the Google casino for bug fixing is terribly frustrating. I\r\nGoogle a bit and after a while find a posting where some poor\r\nunfortunate soul has encountered __exactly__ the same problem that I\r\nhave. My heart leaps for joy. My trembling fingers enter the magic\r\nspell that will remove the curse, and ... nothing. The problem\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nHow come the fix works for some people but not for me. Is there a\r\nmalicious God that is watching over me, or am I in a local area of the\r\nuniverse where the laws of physics have temporarily changed? No the\r\ninitial state of our two machines are different, and so what fixes a\r\nbug on one machine in one state will not necessarily fix a bug on a\r\nmachine in a different state.\r\n\r\nIt is at times like this that I wish I programmed in Smalltalk and\r\nthat we all started with exactly the same program image - Smalltalk\r\nprogrammers must live in a kind of heaven where this cannot happen,\r\nbut then one day even their programs might have to talk to other\r\nprograms and the fun will start.\r\n\r\nFixing broken stuff is doubly frustrating, since even when you've made\r\nthe bug go away, you don't really know if it was the last thing you\r\ndid that fixed the problem or the net effect of all the changes you\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThis problem is, by the way, the thing that takes most of my time,\r\n60-70% of my time at a guess. I once spent over a week trying to get\r\na broken LDAP server to work - my boss had forbidden me to implement my own\r\nLDAP server - but after a week of struggling with a broken LDAP sever\r\nwritten in C and badly documented I had a lapse of memory and forget \r\nthat my boss said and accidentally implemented a server from scratch\r\nin Erlang during my lunch break.\r\n\r\nTo be honest it wasn't a full LDAP sever, but I didn't want a full LDAP server.\r\nI only wanted a couple of commands to work, and that was pretty easy to fix.\r\n\r\nNow I find no particular joy in implementing archaic and perverse protocols\r\nbut often the quickest way to progress is to re-implement them from scratch.\r\n\r\n# Solving problems but not learning\r\n\r\nI'm lazy, I'm a good for nothing slacker. But when I want to put a\r\ndiagram into LaTeX I don't want to have to read a 391 page manual\r\nfirst. Now I know you will accuse me of laziness and of being of unsound\r\nmoral character, and I know I should read the friendly manual first,\r\nbut I want a diagram in my document within ten\r\nminutes reading the 391 page manual is off the radar.\r\n\r\nWhen solving problems I go for the quick solution method - but in the\r\nlong term this is disastrous.\r\n\r\nTake document production. I vacillate between TeX/LaTeX and XSLT-FO\r\nand my own Erlguten.\r\n\r\nAbout once every three years I get a strong desire to write all my\r\ndocuments directly in postscript, and then the only thing to do is\r\ntake a deep breath and wait until the feeling goes away.\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess Giambattista Bondoni when he produced his Manuale Tipografico\r\nin 1818 wasn't particular concerned if typesetting a single page took a\r\nfew weeks but now when we have much more time because we can get\r\nmachines to do the boring and dangerous stuff we don't have time to do\r\nthings properly.\r\n\r\nI asked my boss if he wanted ``nice slides'' for the next\r\npresentation, he said yes, provided I got them to him before\r\ntomorrow. This leaves no time to learn TeX properly (which I guess\r\ncould be accomplished in a couple of years or so) no time to implement\r\nmy own typesetting language (which would take five-ten years) no time\r\nto write it directly in postscript (a week or so) - So I guess it's\r\nPowerPoint.\r\n\r\n# Bad environment for programming\r\n\r\nIf you've gotten this far, you'll understand that I think programming is pretty\r\ndamn difficult. That's why workplaces are designed to make programming even more\r\ndifficult. We have open plan offices which provide a noisy environment\r\nto break our concentration, mobile phones to disturb us, and internet to distract us.\r\n\r\nFortunately we have place to go to where we cannot be\r\ndistracted. Sleep. A lot of programming problems get solved while you\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods. First you load your brain with\r\nproblems, then you sleep then the next day you wake up and some of\r\nthe problems are solved. Easy.\r\n\r\nMethod two - you post your problem on the internet, or tweet about it\r\nbefore going to bed and the next day somebody has mailed you the solution.\r\n\r\nBeing a good programmer takes a long time, you need to learn lots of\r\nstuff and you need to know who to ask when you get stuck.\r\n\r\n# Amazing but true\r\n\r\nWhen I'd finished this article, I wanted to spell check the content.\r\nemacs-ispell mode decided to go on strike. It could not find aspell,\r\nthe program that I use for spelling checking.\r\n\r\nMy emacs spell checker has worked faithfully on this machine for\r\nseveral years. And just when I complain that I spend half my life\r\nfixing things that shouldn't be broken the emacs spell checker decides\r\nto break.\r\n\r\nI don't believe in malicious Gods, nor that the laws of physics are\r\ndifferent in the left-hand corner of the sofa in my front room where\r\nI'm typing this, though there is circumstantial evidence to suggest the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nI could see no reason why my spelling checker should break - Everything\r\nis fine, I have changed nothing. Well I have installed a new version\r\nof Erlang and installed Julia and written some lecture notes since I\r\nlast spell checked a document.\r\n\r\nFortunately eleven minutes with the Google casino worked. The second\r\nsuggestion of how to fix my problem worked - and I still don't know\r\nwhy emacs could not find aspell - and life is too short to find out\r\nwhy.\r\n\r\nI guess there are some things we'll just never know.\r\n\r\n

为什么编程难？\r\n\r\n编程本身不是很难，就像学习英文一样，一个字母，一个单词很好学，但要把很多个单词组成一个通顺，语法准确的句子就很难。编程也是一样的，基本语法，关键字都很好理解，写一个简短的代码，运行正确就可以非常之容易，但要写大规模使用，而且不断要更新的代码就很难了。我刚接触代码的时候，觉得这个很是容易，不管是一个HelloWord，还是一个四则运算，手到擒来；当我进了公司，实习了这段时间，发现要写一个能实际运用的代码是相当复杂的，不管是结构，还是算法，都要进行慎重考虑，保证程序可以正常运行，当新增一个功能时，还要尽可能的保证已有的功能不会受到太大的影响，这都要求我们要有清晰的编程思路和良好的代码编写风格。\r\n代码是一个很抽象的东西，当你写好一段代码之后，对于别人来说就是一些英文字母，而对于我们程序员来说就，脑海中就应该要有这段代码运行的结果。把实际问题转化成一个个都代码，这个也是我认为编程难的原因之一。当然，或许对于有多年编程经验的大神来说，这个就是小case了。"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/comments/184108729","html_url":"https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/37#issuecomment-184108729","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/37","id":184108729,"user":{"login":"lzyforever","id":10767609,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10767609?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever","html_url":"https://github.com/lzyforever","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lzyforever/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2016-02-15T08:22:09Z","updated_at":"2016-02-15T08:22:09Z","body":"**_不动手就很难_**"}]
