# The Evolution of Culture

> And therefore to assume there was one person gave a name  
> To everything, and that all learned their first words from the same,  
> Is stuff and nonsense. Why should one human being from among  
> The rest be able to designate and name things with his tongue  
> And others not possess the power to do likewise? ...

Lucretius, [De Rerum Natura](http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Things-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447962), Book 5, lines 1041-5
