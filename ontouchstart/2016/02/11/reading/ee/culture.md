# The Evolution of Culture

#### From the [book](index.html)

> And therefore to assume there was one person gave a name  
> To everything, and that all learned their first words from the same,  
> Is stuff and nonsense. Why should one human being from among  
> The rest be able to designate and name things with his tongue  
> And others not possess the power to do likewise? ...

Lucretius, [De Rerum Natura](http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Things-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140447962), Book 5, lines 1041-5

> The key point is that there is no choreographer and no leader. Order, organization, structure &mdash; these all emerge as by-products of rules which are obeyed locally and many times over.

Richard Dawkins, [The Greatest Show on Earth](http://www.amazon.com/The-Greatest-Show-Earth-Evolution/dp/1416594795)

#### Note

The keyword here is "locally". In top-down designed organization, the dependency is *global*; but in bottom-up grown organism, it is *local*. 

Not only the change is local, the communication is also mostly local until a centralized "broadcast" system appears. That is the difference between "word of mouth" and "propaganda".

The change from single source broadcast to multi-source broadcast (social media) would have some impact on how culture evolves. We see it coming but do not know where it would go.
